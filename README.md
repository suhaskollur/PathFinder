## About The Project

The project aims to develop a robust Learning Management System (LMS), namely PATHFINDER, tailored to the needs of Rutgers University-New Brunswick's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. This system will streamline various efficient student operations, including Student Operations that include, Student Registration/Login, Course Lookup, Course Enrollment, Course Drop, Adhering to Announcements posted globally, Submitting Assignments, Viewing Grades and setting up Student Profiles. Coming to the Professor Operations, these include Professor Registration/Login, Listing Courses, enrolling to the courses to be taught by the professor, Posting Assignments and its grades to the respective students, publishing Announcements and Creating new Courses and many more. The system is engineered to meet the demanding standards and dynamic needs of higher education in the fields of electrical and computer engineering.
